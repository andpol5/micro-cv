## ASSIGNMENT: IMAGE-PROCESSING MICROLIBRARY ##
Please write a small library for applying a series of transformations to an image in the language of your choice. For the purposes of this assignment, the library only needs to support two transformations:  

* Convert the image to grayscale
* Any one of these transforms (we respect your time -- please only implement one!):
	* Crop the image
	* Resize the image
	* Or just surprise us with an image transformation of your choice!

I encourage you to reach out with any questions you have.

## EXPECTATIONS ##
We expect the code to be at the bar that you consider "production quality." For us, that means:

* It meets the technical requirements ("it works")
* It is at a state where you could comfortably open-source the library, or could reasonably hand it over to be maintained by another engineer.

From another perspective, the library should be in a state in which you would be happy to receive it if you were tapped to become its new maintainer.

We will assess your work on these dimensions:

* ability to ask the right questions
* robust, meaningful tests & documentation
* ability to write readable, well-structured code
* clearly communicated reasoning about the code
* resourcefulness
